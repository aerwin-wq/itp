# **Harmony Atlas — Final Project Proposal**

## **Title**
**Harmony Atlas: A Searchable Database of Chord Progressions and Harmony Types**

## **1-Sentence Overview**
A searchable digital database that categorizes musical excerpts by harmony type (e.g., modal interchange, secondary dominants, chromatic mediants) using sourced scores and automatically transcribed MIDI.

## **Resources (3 Specific Hyperlinked Sources)**

- **MuseScore Score Library** — https://musescore.com/sheetmusic  
- **Basic Pitch (Spotify)** — https://basicpitch.spotify.com/  
- **Open Studio Music Analysis Channel** — https://www.youtube.com/openstudiojazz
---

## **Project Overview**
*Harmony Atlas* will be a small but functional web-based database of musical excerpts sorted by harmony type. I will gather musical examples from MuseScore downloads and Basic Pitch transcriptions of YouTube audio. Each excerpt will be labeled with harmonic tags such as modal interchange, secondary dominant, chromatic mediant, extended chord structures, and other common harmony types. The database will let users browse or search excerpts based on harmonic function rather than composer or genre. Each entry will include a score image, metadata, and optional MIDI playback. The project will serve as a learning tool and a prototype for a larger educational resource.

## **Overlap With Other Work**
Some harmonic analysis techniques overlap with my general coursework, but **no part of this project is being submitted for any other class**. This class is taught by **Professor Rachel**.

---

## **GOOD Outcome (Minimum Guaranteed)**
- A working database with at least **50 musical examples**, each correctly categorized by harmony type.

## **BETTER Outcome (Expected Goal)**
- A functional web interface with **search + filter** (by harmony type, composer, or source).  
- **100–200 fully analyzed excerpts** with PDFs/PNGs of notation and accompanying MIDI playback.

## **BEST Outcome (Ideal Hope)**
- A polished interface with **tag search, audio playback, score preview**, and **500+ harmony-labeled excerpts**.  
- Optional: automatic detection suggestions based on Basic Pitch output.

## **Project Timeline (Calendar With Specific Dates)**

### **Week 1 — Nov 15–Nov 21**
- Finalize list of harmony categories.  
- Create data schema (JSON/CSV): title, harmony type, score image, MIDI, notes.  
- Select candidate musical pieces.  
- Download some MuseScore scores and test workflow.

### **Week 2 — Nov 22–Nov 28**
- Transcribe more YouTube excerpts using Basic Pitch.  
- Extract measures containing target harmonic events.  
- Begin labeling examples manually.  
- Build initial dataset folder structure.

### **Week 3 — Nov 29–Dec 5**
- Build basic web interface:  
  - search bar  
  - dropdown filter by harmony type  
  - display score images + metadata  
- Insert at least 10 entries (**GOOD outcome checkpoint**).

### **Week 4 — Dec 6–Dec 12**
- Add more entries
- Improve UI styling and metadata formatting.  
- Add MIDI playback.

### **Final Week — Dec 13–Dec 18**
- Polish interface, debug features.  
- Add final examples  
- Complete documentation and submit final project.
